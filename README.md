# Our Aim
Currently, there are limited applications to centralize medical records across all the hospitals, making it hard for the doctor to get patientâ€™s medical records from other hospitals.  

However, if hospitals share their database, it will raise privacy issues and information leaks. Hence, via MediDoc, we aim to empower the patients to have the rights to aggregate their medical data across hospitals. 

This solution involves a mobile application for the patients and a website for the medical personnel. .

# Patient Mobile App
A folder containing an interative wireframe of the patient's mobile app is included. User can explore the mobile application by simply clicking some of the interactions that we have include in the wireframe.


# Medical Personnel Website 
The folder containing the interactive wireframe has been uploaded. This website enables the user to search the patient's ID and select the medical documents to be uploaded or downloaded. 


# Integration of mobile application and website 
NOTE: the patient's medical personnel website must be used in line with the patient's mobile application in order for medical document sharing. A notification will be sent to the patient's mobile application upon document request by the medical professional. User will then decide whether or not to approve the document sharing.
