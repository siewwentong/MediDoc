# Our Aim
Currently, there are limited applications to centralize medical records across all the hospitals, making it hard for the doctor to get patientâ€™s medical records from other hospitals.  

However, if hospitals share their database, it will raise privacy issues and information leaks. Hence, via MediDoc, we aim to empower the patients to have the rights to aggregate their medical data across hospitals. 

This solution involves a mobile application for the patients and a website for the medical personnel. .

## Patient Mobile App
This folder contains an interative wireframe of the patient's mobile app is included. 
Features included are:
- Trend analysis of health indexes such as weight, cholesterol level etc. 
- Viewing all medical records stored on the database
- Notifications to remind patients to take their medicines, or to take neccessary medical check ups
- Approving or declining medical personnels' requests to view the user's medical records


## Medical Personnel Website Dashboard
This folder contains the interactive wireframe has been uploaded. 
The features includes:
- Searching for the patient's medical record cia the patient's ID
- select, requesting access or upload the medical documents 


## Integration of mobile application and website 
For the medical document sharing, the patient mobile app must be present in order for the patient's medical personnel to access their medical records. 
A notification will be sent to the patient's mobile application upon the request of documents by the medical professional. The patient will then decide whether or not to approve the medical document sharing. 

# To note:
This just serves as a prototype of the solution proposed to visualise how the software will work if implemented. Hence, not all buttons are functionable. The demonstration of the prototype can be viewed here:
