# Our Aim
Currently, there are limited applications to centralize medical records across all the hospitals, making it hard for the doctor to get patient’s medical records from other hospitals.  

However, if hospitals share their database, it will raise privacy issues and information leaks. Hence, via MediDoc, we aim to empower the patients to have the rights to aggregate their medical data across hospitals. 

Our solution involves a mobile application for the patients and a website for the medical personnel. Now let’s see the features of the mobile application.


# Patient Mobile App
We have uploaded a folder containing an interative wireframe of the patient's mobile app, where you can explore the mobile application by simply click some of the interactions that we have include in the wireframe.
